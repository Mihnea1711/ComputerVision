# ComputerVision
A repository featuring labs from my university's Computer Vision course, demonstrating practical applications in image processing, object detection, and segmentation.

## Computer Vision Course Projects

In this repository, I'll be documenting my progress through the Computer Vision course at my university. Throughout the course, we'll progressively implement five projects:

    Project 1: Lane Detection
    Project 2: Digit Recognition
    Project 3: Image Stitching
        Creating panoramas
    Project 4: Stereo
    Project 5: Object Detection using neural networks

All projects will be implemented using Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks.

Stay tuned for updates and explorations into the fascinating world of computer vision!
